# Play Yourself

> In this study I build an HTML audio player from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjESJSAfBXE) tutorial. It was loads of fun, and I tried to make it a little more interesting with a neumorphic interface from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbpQDnsJ-qk). The music is from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8K2QRwKq54).
